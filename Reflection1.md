**CS211 SPRING 2020**

https://github.com/leejanzen91/TeamProject01


Having used Github for previous group projects, Lee set up a similar github interface for our CS211 group right away. Andy created us a discord, which proved to be immensely valuable for continued group discussion outside of class. We used the discord to discuss our strategy, send references to java code material, and communicate throughout the project. After that was established, Harold worked on the person class, and Lee set about creating the main interface. Andy tried to help with sorting the name into Name>Mother>Father>Children but having not read the chapter struggled to create the class. Despite lots of editing, he was very involved in the codes creation and in offering some new perspectives. Aayush Budhiraja, our assigned group lead, was unfortunately unavailable for the duration of the project, although offered to help on the Github channel but was ultimately busy.

I took a lot of my lessons with me from CS210 and set up the Github in a similar interface that worked for my first group projects. Andy struggled a bit, but thanks to the discord they created I felt we still had plenty of ability to create contribution despite inexperience with the GitHub interface. After this I went about creating the main code client. The first few iterations of the code were, frankly, terrible. It took a long time to get it up and running. Much of breaking down the project happened while I wrote the Main client. During our first meeting we knew it needed a person class, file reader, a user search prompt, and a method that would sort the family tree. It wasnâ€™t until I wrote the main user prompt that I realized we needed a find method to determine if the name was even in the file. Harold helped a lot with cleaning it up to a functional point after they finished the Person.java class. Once we got it going it was a matter of sorting through all the data correctly. At this point things ran pretty smoothly, but I got stuck on returning children at the end.

At the early stages of this project I was a little unsure on what we were supposed to do, so what I started off with was just understanding the list patterns in hopes of being able to get information that would set me on the right track. Later it turned out that the information I collected from the list came in the late stages of our development, which was to find the relations of the person that was chosen. The information helped the main test client team out later when they worked on it I think. My judgement after realizing this led me to work on the Person class mostly solo with some revisions by Lee and the others. The development of the Person class took a total of 3 days, 1 including the revision process. The two following days of this project for me were just looking at the main test client code and finding what I could do to make the code more readable for the main team so that they could work on it efficiently. Overall it was a pleasure to work with this group of people.
