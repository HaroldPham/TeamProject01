Having used Github for previous group projects, Lee set up a similar github interface for our CS211 group right away. Andy created us a discord, which proved to be immensely valuable for continued group discussion outside of class. We used the discord to discuss our strategy, send references to java code material, and communicate throughout the project. After that was established, Harold worked on the person class, and Lee set about creating the main interface. Andy tried to help with sorting the name into Name>Mother>Father>Children but having not read the chapter struggled to create the class. Despite lots of editing, he was very involved in the codes creation and in offering some new perspectives. Aayush Budhiraja, our assigned group lead, was unfortunately unavailable for the duration of the project, although offered to help on the Github channel but was ultimately busy.

I took a lot of my lessons with me from CS210 and set up the Github in a similar interface that worked for my first group projects. Andy struggled a bit, but thanks to the discord they created I felt we still had plenty of ability to create contribution despite inexperience with the GitHub interface. After this I went about creating the main code client. The first few iterations of the code were, frankly, terrible. It took a long time to get it up and running. Much of breaking down the project happened while I wrote the Main client. During our first meeting we knew it needed a person class, file reader, a user search prompt, and a method that would sort the family tree. It wasnâ€™t until I wrote the main user prompt that I realized we needed a find method to determine if the name was even in the file. Harold helped a lot with cleaning it up to a functional point after they finished the Person.java class. Once we got it going it was a matter of sorting through all the data correctly. At this point things ran pretty smoothly, but I got stuck on returning children at the end.
