//example:
Our team began by finding repetition to our code. We broke down repeated phrases in the song, marking each with a number to
indicate the phrase. There were 4 repeated static methods, which were delegated among members to be written. The team decided 
these methods would be named after the number assigned to them (ie. One, two, three, four). While the methods were written the
team lead wrote the main program, calling the static methods as appropriate. These methods were then posted to our team forum and 
copy and pasted into the bottom of the code. Upon compiling here, our code ran. However, Cheyenne noticed there were some more 
specific instructions, to call each verse as a method. The code was quickly edited to align with these standards by the team lead,
while Ella created a Github for our group. We hadn’t liked the CANVAS system for sharing code and wanted to alter our future 
processes for group collaboration. The final code was posted to the Team Project Github for editing and team contribution.

//example:
I was the team lead for our project, and quickly set to delegating tasks. We were done quickly, and I was happy with the progress. All the team members really helped to contribute, and communication went well. I had challenges finding things for our new group member to do, as she had just started. I wasn’t sure how far along she was in the course work, so I had her follow along with me as best I could while managing the project. Everyone did a great job of speaking up and adding their strengths to the group. Most importantly, I feel we are now better prepared for a larger and more complex project together, like we will see in the future with the course work. I heavily insisted on using Github for all group project related concerns, in part because I feel it’s important to understand the platform and to make contributions. We are all very new to the experience, and learning how to make contributions to Github effectively.
