Having used Github for previous group projects, Lee set up a similar github interface for our CS211 group right away. Andy created us a discord, which proved to be immensely valuable for continued group discussion outside of class. We used the discord to discuss our strategy, send references to java code material, and communicate throughout the project. After that was established, Harold worked on the person class, and Lee set about creating the main interface. Andy tried to help with sorting the name into Name>Mother>Father>Children but having not read the chapter struggled to create the class. Despite lots of editing, he was very involved in the codes creation and in offering some new perspectives. Aayush Budhiraja, our assigned group lead, was unfortunately unavailable for most of the project. He provided a cell phone photo of his originally assigned "read file" function, which was reffered to as retain all. We never revcieved the code other than a photo which was not legible, so it was never part of the project. When requested, he stated that he didn't have functional internet access, which also explained his inability to speak up during our project planning stage.

I took a lot of my lessons with me from CS210 and set up the Github in a similar interface that worked for my first group projects. Andy struggled a bit, but thanks to the discord they created I felt we still had plenty of ability to create contribution despite inexperience with the GitHub interface. After this I went about creating the main code client. The first few iterations of the code were, frankly, terrible. It took a long time to get it up and running. Much of breaking down the project happened while I wrote the Main client. During our first meeting we knew it needed a person class, file reader, a user search prompt, and a method that would sort the family tree. It wasn’t until I wrote the main user prompt that I realized we needed a find method to determine if the name was even in the file. Harold helped a lot with cleaning it up to a functional point after they finished the Person.java class. Once we got it going it was a matter of sorting through all the data correctly. At this point things ran pretty smoothly, but I got stuck on returning children at the end. This was resolved by adding a final for loop to print the entire Children array.

For this project our team started off by finding out what the main goal of this project is. We had come to the conclusion that what we needed to get done with the project was to make a program that would parse through tudor.dat file and sort names into the proper family when the user searched for a name. I got tasked at fixing the array that handled all the names and adding the retainAll method to get rid of names that we didn’t need. As a team we diligently started working on the files and had a few run-ins with the code that prevented us from executing code, but we polished up the code to make it run properly. Our team was hard working throughout the project and worked/communicated properly. Throughout the project we used GitHub to work on the project together and see what changes were made to the project. We also communicated our ideas, problems, and doubts through Discord. Each member worked on their share of the project fairly and helped others when help was needed. Overall my take on this project is that this was a success that we as a team could work together and get our code to work as intended to.
