# Team 3, SPRING 2020, CS211

### Project01
In your textbook, Building Java Programs, 5th Edition, on page 720 of Chapter 10, please do Programming Project #3.

The format of the data input file for this project will be two lists: a list of person names, one per line of the file, which is followed by a list of these person names and their family member names, also one entry per line. This second list will be in the order person, mother, then father. The list of original person names will be terminated in the file by a line containing the string, "END". After that list will come the person names, followed by those of the family member names, grouped as above and also terminated with "END". There is a test file, tudor.datPreview the document, that you should use for your completion testing, a link to which you can find in this module. You might also wish to make another, perhaps shorter file, e.g., of your own family for a few (two or three, say) generations, for your development testing purposes. As a source of helpful visuals, there is also a Web site you may wish visit at https://www.britroyals.com/index.asp (Links to an external site.). Another visual you may find helpful is in genealogy_chart-Tudors-Stuarts.pdf.

While it is not explicitly specified in the project specification found in the text, the user query component of this project must be able to support as many queries from a user as the user wishes; each opportunity must be prompted, with the prompt including the sentinel for input when the user is ready to quit.

### Project02

In your textbook, Building Java Programs, 5th Edition, on page 1027 (1026 eBook) of Chapter 16 please do Programming Project #3.

The implimentation of several methods is (or can be) the same between our ArrayList and LinkedList. Write a common abstract superclass called AbstractList that impliments the common behavior and is extended by both ArrayList and LinkedList. Facotr out the common code from the two list classes into this abstract superclass so that no code duplication occurs between the two. Use iterators whenever possible in the abstract code to ensure that the implimentation is efficient for both types of lists.

###Project Expectations

As a group project, the development work must be divided up into parts that can be done by individuals in your group, by group agreement. Your job will be to meet, both in class and on Canvas, via Canvas Mail, to parcel out the work and coordinate your efforts toward completing the project program.

If the group leader currently assigned is not willing to serve, you must choose a team leader by group consensus. This person will have the job of coordinating the efforts of the team members, and assembling the completed project for submission. The output of the project will be a ZIP archive, similar to a homework assignment, that is submitted by the team leader. It must contain all the Java source files needed for the project, and a word document describing the process of completing the project.

Each member of the team will also submit a Word (.docx) or text (.txt) document, describing her or his contribution to the project and a characterization of the project process, from his or her perspective. Note that this document must be forwarded to the team leader for inclusion in the ZIP archive that is submitted for the team. That individual must submit the ZIP archive, which must include her or his own descriptive document, as well as those from each of the rest of the team. In short, the only submission for this project will be the one ZIP archive, submitted by the team leader. If you have questions about any of this, please see me.
